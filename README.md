This project is based on the paper entitled *A Comparison of Nine Confidence Intervals for a Poisson Parameter When the Expected Number of Events  <= 5* (Barker, L., 2002) (https://www.jstor.org/stable/3087376?seq=1). 

The aim of the project is the comparison of 5 different methods for computing a 95% confidence interval for the mean of a Poisson distribution. The 5 different methods are:
* The Wald interval
* The score interval
* The variance-stablizing interval
* The exact method
* The bootstrap method
--- 

The comparison study is conducted through an application on the `mdvis` dataset found in the `COUNT` R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/COUNT/COUNT.pdf).
