## PROJECT 2: CONFIDENCE INTERVAL A FOR POISSON MEAN

This project is based on the paper entitled *A Comparison of Nine Confidence Intervals for a Poisson Parameter When the Expected Number of Events  <= 5* (Barker, L., 2002). 

The aim of the project is the comparison of 5 different methods for computing a 95% confidence interval for the mean of a Poisson distribution. The 5 different methods are:
* The Wald interval
* The score interval
* The variance-stablizing interval
* The exact method
* The bootstrap method
